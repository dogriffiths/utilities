# Web-Based Utilities and Tools

Welcome to this collection of web-based tools! This project is a group of simple programs that help people complete tasks, process information, and improve workflows. Some tools were written by me, and others were created with help from AI. These tools are made for many different users, such as developers, project managers, or anyone who needs quick solutions online.

## Features
- **Web-based**: These tools are designed to run in the browser, requiring minimal setup.
- **AI Collaboration**: Some tools were co-created using AI, bringing an innovative touch to solving problems.

The Data URI Image Viewer is a lightweight web tool that helps developers and designers work with data URI encoded images. It provides a seamless way to visualize and manipulate image data URIs by allowing direct pasting of encoded strings or drag-and-drop of image files, automatically handling common string formatting issues like quotes and escapes.

#### Main features

- Paste data URIs directly into a text area to preview the image
- Handles various text formats (quoted strings, escaped characters, trailing semicolons)
- Drag and drop new images onto the preview to replace existing ones
- Automatic conversion of dropped images to data URI format
- Visual feedback during drag operations
- Live preview updates when pasting or dropping
