# Web-Based Utilities and Tools

Welcome to this collection of web-based tools! This project is a group of simple programs that help people complete tasks, process information, and improve workflows. Some tools were written by me, and others were created with help from AI. These tools are made for many different users, such as developers, project managers, or anyone who needs quick solutions online.

## Features
- **Web-based**: These tools are designed to run in the browser, requiring minimal setup.
- **AI Collaboration**: Some tools were co-created using AI, bringing an innovative touch to solving problems.

### [Markdown to Unicode Converter](https://dogriffiths.github.io/utilities/unicode.html) (Made with Claude.AI)

This web app, built with Claude.ai, lets you write text using markdown and change it into Unicode characters. You can copy and paste the text as plain text, but it keeps the format, even on platforms that do not support formatting, like LinkedIn posts. This tool helps you make bold, italic, and other styled text that looks plain but keeps the style, so your content stands out where formatting is limited.

#### Main features

- **Markdown formatting**: Write text using markdown syntax for bold, italic, headers, and more.
- **Unicode conversion**: Converts markdown text into Unicode characters to retain formatting.
- **Copy and paste as plain text**: Allows you to copy the formatted text as plain text that keeps its style.
- **Works on platforms without formatting support**: Use formatted text on platforms like LinkedIn that normally donâ€™t allow rich text formatting.
