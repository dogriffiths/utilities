### Simple Whiteboard App (Made with Claude.AI)

This is a light and easy-to-use web tool for drawing and sharing ideas. The whiteboard app lets you sketch, write, and organize your thoughts visually. Made with Claude.AI, it is simple but useful for brainstorming or note-taking.

#### Main Features:
- **Multiple Whiteboards**: You can create more than one whiteboard. Easily switch between boards to organize your ideas better.
- **Undo Option**: If you make a mistake, use the undo button to go back and fix it.
